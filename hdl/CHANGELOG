bladeRF HDL Change Log Summary

hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/nuand/bladeRF
================================================================================

v0.3.1 (2015-06-17)
--------------------------------
 * Added faster, custom SPI block for LMS6 communication.
    - This custom block removes large gaps of time between CSn and the clocking
      of data, as well as gaps of time between bytes.

v0.3.0 (2015-06-17)
--------------------------------
 This version is part of development series of changes, not an official release.

 * Added support for the following packet formats.
    - pkt_8x8
    - pkt_8x16
    - pkt_8x32
    - pkt_8x64
    - pkt_32x32

   For more information about these packet formats, see:
    bladeRF/hdl/fpga/ip/altera/nios_system/software/bladeRF_nios/README.md

v0.2.0 (2015-06-17)
--------------------------------
 This version is part of development series of changes, not an official release.

 * Redesigned control/configuration program running on NIOS II
    - This introduces support for different packet formats for
      NIOS II <-> host communication.
    - Readability and performance improvements

 * The time tamers have been separated and now have programmable interrupts.

 * Added tuning support:
    - The LMS6 VCOCAP search can now be performed in the NIOS,
      cutting out overhead incurred when performing all register accesses
      via the host.
    - A "Quick tune" option allows the LMS6 to be tuned using previously
      determined settings, instead of running the full tuning algorithm.
    - Introduced scheduled retune support


v0.1.2 (2014-10-22)
--------------------------------
 * Fixed issues with TX_NOW and dropped messages. This fixes issues
   #334 and #335.

v0.1.1 (2014-10-22)
--------------------------------
 * Fixed timing errors that caused failures in SPI communication with the
   LMS6002D. This addresses the LMS calbration failure assocaited with issue
   #269.

v0.1.0 (2014-10-21)
--------------------------------
 * Backwards-compatible features introduced:
    - Added option to divide sample counter by 2.
    - Added "TX_NOW"

 * Fixes:
    - Addessed data/timestamp slipping
    - Fixed readback of current timestamp value
    - Send zero samples TX module to mitigate effect of default output power
      from the LMS after intialization.


v0.0.6 (2014-07-20)
--------------------------------
 * Fixed FPGA correction for gain/phase

v0.0.5 (2014-06-21)
--------------------------------
 * Added expansion board support for XB-200


v0.0.4 (2014-05-07)
--------------------------------
 * Added metadata timestamp support
    - Added RX/TX metadata FIFOs
 * Added FPGA digital loopback


v0.0.3 (2014-02-01)
--------------------------------
 * Tweaked constraints for FX3 interface drive strength
 * Add 32-bit counter mode for RX performance testing


v0.0.2 (2014-01-14)
--------------------------------
 * Tweaked constraints for the FX3 interface
 * Fixed SPI/UART signal contention issue
 * Fixed phase range for IQ correction block


v0.0.1 (2013-12-28)
--------------------------------
 * Updated to use Quartus 13.1 tools
    - Renamed OpenCores I2C Qsys core to not conflict
 * Introduced faster UART bridge (4Mbps versus 115.2kbps)
 * Added IQ correction block
 * Added FPGA version numbering
 * Made FX3 GPIF FSM more maintainable
