The `bladeRF_frs.grc` flowgraph implements an FRS transceiver capable of
operating on any subset of the FRS channels. More information may be found in
the paper, [An SDR-Based FRS Transceiver: Prototyping a multi-channel FRS transceiver with CTCSS support via GNU Radio and the Nuand bladeRF](https://github.com/Nuand/nuand-papers/releases/download/20150614/bladeRF_frs.pdf), from the
